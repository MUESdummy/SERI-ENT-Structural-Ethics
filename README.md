# SERI v0.1 â€” Structural Ethics Readiness Index (ENT-Aligned)

**SERI v0.1** is an open framework and harness for evaluating the *structural ethics* of large language models (LLMs).  
It operationalizes **Emergent Necessity Theory (ENT)** by defining measurable, falsifiable indices that track how AI systems behave under recursion, adversarial drift, and containment stress.

This repository contains:
- âœ… The **SERI harness** (Python) â€” runs scenarios and produces JSON logs.
- âœ… A **JSON schema** for validating results.
- âœ… An academic **paper** (LaTeX + PDF) with framework + synthetic results.
- âœ… Example configs + replication checklist.

## ðŸ“– Background

- **Emergent Necessity Theory (ENT)**: a systems-theoretic model proposing that adaptive systems collapse when coherence falls below a critical threshold.  
- **SERI** extends ENT into AI ethics by defining:
  - **RCI** â€” Recursion Containment Index  
  - **DSI** â€” Drift Susceptibility Index  
  - **HSM** â€” Hysteresis Safety Margin  
  - **SOR** â€” Symbolic Overreach Risk  
  - **ETT** â€” Externality Traceability Time  

Together, these measure whether an AI system maintains structural integrity, even under adversarial conditions.
